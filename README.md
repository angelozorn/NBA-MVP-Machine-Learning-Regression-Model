# NBA-MVP-Machine-Learning-Regression-Model
Machine learning model predicting NBA MVP based on previous season's stats

Expanding on a previous prediction algorithm I created, I wanted to see how machine learning models would compare to my algorithm. Using the same data I was able to get a better accuracy score using machine learning. The highest accuracy model is hyper parameter tuned random forest regressor training for 10 years and testing for 16 with accurary 75%
